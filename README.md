# ItunesSearchExample

## Requirements

* Swift 5
* Xcode 12+

## Installation
Clone the repository and run.

## Project Structure

I chose to use MVVM in this project. I used to use it with RxSwift before, but I don't prefer it because has steep learning curve. You can check out my projects I have done with other architectures on my github repository.

## Things I think are missing
- Couldn't pay much attention to UI.
- Too many missing comment out.
- I just wrote API test as unit test. If I had more time, I could write more test.
